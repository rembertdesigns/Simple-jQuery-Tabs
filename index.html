      <h3>First Tab</h3>
      <p>Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? Have fun with it. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="tab2">
      <h3>Second Tab</h3>
      <p>We don't have anything but happy trees here. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. This is a fantastic little painting. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="tab3">
      <h3>Third Tab</h3>
      <p>Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Happy painting, God bless. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. And right there you got an almighty cloud. A fan brush can be your best friend. Look at them little rascals.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="tab4">
      <h3>Fourth Tab</h3>
      <p>Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun.</p>
